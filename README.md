Excellent. This project is a perfect candidate for our **"Architect Package"** and allows us to create a compelling, high-value case study for a sophisticated, data-driven application.

This `README.md` is crafted to the Conscribe Omnia standard. It's not just a set of instructions; it's a strategic document designed to attract sophisticated users, build trust through transparency, and create a clear path for community contribution and potential monetization.

# Project Ganymede: Modular Go Crypto Bot

**Project Ganymede** is a high-performance, browser-based cryptocurrency trading bot with a modular architecture at its core. It leverages the power of Go, compiled to WebAssembly (WASM), to run complex trading strategies and data analysis directly in your browser, offering a secure and highly customizable trading experience.

### The Problem

Algorithmic trading is powerful, but it often requires complex server-side setups, continuous maintenance, and a high degree of trust in third-party platforms. Furthermore, most trading bots are "black boxes," making it difficult for users to understand, customize, or truly own their trading logic.

### The Solution: A Sovereign, Browser-Based Bot

Project Ganymede solves this by moving the entire trading engine into the browser.

  * **Zero Infrastructure:** No servers to manage. Your strategies run locally in your browser tab.
  * **Ultimate Transparency:** The core logic is written in Go and is fully auditable. You can see exactly how it works.
  * **Live Modding:** Inspired by the "sovereign software" ethos of the Sovereign Engine, you can write, compile, and inject your own custom trading strategies in Go directly from the UI.

## 🚀 How It Works: A Modular Architecture

Ganymede is built on a simple but powerful principle: **everything is a swappable module**. This allows for maximum flexibility and customization.

1.  **Data Connectors:** The bot fetches market data through a simple `Connector` interface. The default is a safe `Simulation` connector, but it can be extended to connect to any exchange API (e.g., Coinbase, Binance).
2.  **Strategy Engine:** The core logic resides in the `Strategy` module. The bot ships with standard strategies like SMA Crossover and RSI, but its true power comes from the ability to add your own.
3.  **In-Browser Compilation:** Using Go's native WebAssembly support, you can write a custom strategy in the "User Mods" tab. When you click "Apply," the Go code is recompiled to WASM in real-time and hot-swapped into the running application.

## ✨ Getting Started: One-Click Setup

As a fully browser-based application, there is no complex setup.

1.  **Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.** That's it.
2.  The application will automatically load the pre-compiled Go WASM module and initialize the UI.

### Your First Trade (Simulation Mode)

1.  **Stay on the "Simulation" Connector.** This is the default and requires no API keys.
2.  **Select a Strategy.** Choose the "Simple Moving Average Crossover" from the strategy dropdown.
3.  **Click "Start Bot."**
4.  You will see the chart come to life with simulated price data and the log panel will begin reporting the bot's decisions. BUY and SELL signals will be plotted directly on the chart.

## 🔧 Writing Your Own Strategy (The Core Feature)

This is where Project Ganymede shines. You can create a new trading strategy without ever leaving the application.

1.  **Navigate to the "User Mods" Tab.**
2.  You will find a text editor with a template Go function: `strategyUserMod`.
3.  **Write Your Logic.** Implement your trading logic within this function. You have access to the full `BotState`, including all historical price data.
4.  **Click "Validate"** to ensure your Go code is syntactically correct.
5.  **Click "Apply Mod & Recompile."** Your code will be sent to the in-browser Go compiler, and the new WASM module will be loaded.
6.  Go back to the "Settings" tab and select **"User Mod (Custom)"** from the strategy dropdown to activate your new logic.

**Example Custom Strategy (Simple Momentum):**

```go
// Buy if the price increases by 1% from the previous tick, sell if it decreases by 1%.
func strategyUserMod(bs *BotState) Signal {
    if len(bs.prices) < 2 {
        return HOLD // Not enough data yet
    }

    currentPrice := bs.prices[len(bs.prices)-1]
    previousPrice := bs.prices[len(bs.prices)-2]

    if currentPrice > previousPrice * 1.01 {
        return BUY
    } else if currentPrice < previousPrice * 0.99 {
        return SELL
    }

    return HOLD
}
```

## 🤝 Contributing & The Roadmap

Project Ganymede is an open platform. The best way to contribute is to build and share your own modules.

  * **New Strategies:** Submit your `.go` strategy files to be included as official presets.
  * **New Connectors:** Create a new class that implements the `Connector` interface to add support for more exchanges.

Our goal is to build a community-driven library of powerful, open-source trading tools that put the user in complete control.
